# OpenArena-Project-Reload

Project Reload OA-R is a project designed to update Open Arena 
by adding new icons sounds and anything else that can be added to the base game as a 
replacement for some of the older game assets.

Future more this will serve as a base for later projects in other engines and 
as a way to keep track of all assets that are used in the game to make sure that they stay
compatiable with open source licenses such as GPL2.

# Project Guide lines
 All graphics / art / music etc produced for the project must include the source files!
 For example a new icon will include its .xfc file if it was made in gimp or.kra for krita.
 Things made for the project should be made with free open source software when possible.
 
# Licensing guide 
 Finally all items made for the project must be placed under the gpl2 to stay compatible
 with open arena and allow the use of items in other FOSS projects.
 See gnu.org for information on the glp2 license.
