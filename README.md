# OpenArena-Project-Reload

Project Reload OA-R is a project designed to update Open Arena 
by adding new icons sounds and anything else that can be added to the base game as a 
replacement for some of the older game assets.

This repo will serve as a base for later projects in other engines and 
as a way to keep track of all assets that are used in the game to make sure that they stay
compatiable with open source licenses such as GPL2.
