# OpenArena-Project-Reload

Project Reload OA-R is a project designed to update Open Arena 
by adding new icons sounds and anything else that can be added to the base game as a 
replacement for some of the older game assets.

This repo will serve as a base for later projects in other engines and 
as a way to keep track of all assets that are used in the game to make sure that they stay
compatiable with open source licenses such as GPL2.
 
 I'am in no way affiliated with the open arena team and this so far is a one man passion 
 project to update and keep open arena alive.
