# OpenArena-Project-Reload

Project Reload OA-R is a project designed to update Open Arena 
by adding new icons sounds and anything else that can be added to the base game as a 
replacement for some of the older game assets.

This repo will serve as a base for later projects in other engines and 
as a way to keep track of all assets that are used in the game to make sure that they stay
compatiable with open source licenses such as GPL2.
 
# Licensing guide 
 All items made for the project will be placed under the gpl2 to stay compatible
 with open arena and allow for the use of the items in other FOSS projects.
 See gnu.org for information on the glp2 license.
