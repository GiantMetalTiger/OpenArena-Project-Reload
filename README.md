# OpenArena-Project-Reload

A revival of the open arena project that aims to put a fresh coat of paint on OpenArena
by adding new icons sounds and anything else that can be added to the base game as a 
replacement for some of the older game assets.

Future more this will serve as a base for later open arena projects in other engines and 
as a way to keep track of all assets that are used in the game to make sure that they stay
compatiable with open source licenses such as GPL3 MIT or ZLIB.
